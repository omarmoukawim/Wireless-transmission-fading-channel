# Wireless-transmission-fading-channel
In this project the task was to observe how the transmitted power and BER (Bit error rate) is affected by employing different symbol lengths and modulations (BPSK, 4/8/16/64 PSK and 4/8/16/64 QAM) the transmission was simulated over Rayleigh, Rician and Gaussian channels.
