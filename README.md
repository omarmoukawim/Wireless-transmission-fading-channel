# Wireless-transmission-fading-channel
In this project the task was to observe how varying the symbol transmitting power affected the BER (Bit error rate). Different symbol lengths and modulations were analyzed (BPSK, 4/8/16/64 PSK and 4/8/16/64 QAM) and the transmission was simulated over Rayleigh, Rician and Gaussian channels.
